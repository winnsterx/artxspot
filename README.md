## Next Steps

- ~~Add "another playlist" button~~
- ~~Fix "another art" button's access problem~~

  Note: Adding in React Router significantly complicated my problem. By sitting down and thinking through my conditional logic clearly, the solution was as easy as setting up 2 hook variables. It also helps to glance at an article titled "React Hooks is set to replace React Router".

- ~~Fix top-margin in /artwork's image~~
- ~~Fix playlists partial background / layout issue~~
- ~~Set artwork image size to be relative to window size~~
- ~~Set render artwork layout correctly immediately~~
- ~~Hook custom URL (artxspot.com) on firebase~~
- Research on Spotify's UI/UX to use
- Improve landing page
