Things I think would be a cool spotify feature:

- See who are these fucking followers on your playlist

- Auto generate image cover for playlist
  - if I can select some characteristics: classical art, tumblr, nature, pink, colours, mood
- Bot verifications (how to identify who are the fucking bots on your followers)
- Some way of gaining followers on playlist or profile
  - Super vague, some sort of promotions?

Apparently, one can monetize spotify playlists

Music curation service:

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/dining/restaurant-music-playlists-ryuichi-sakamoto.html

- Ryuichi Sakamoto offered to curate playlist for the restaurant, changing it every season
- Music is a sensory experience essential
- Offer playlist curation as a service coupled with field study of the environment and ambience
- Advantage over autonomous playlist is personalized to ur environment, also broad music taste that u dont seem to have
- https://www.musicto.com/do-you-really-want-to-be-a-music-to-curator
  - Might be a good stepping stone before initiating a full grown personal project
- There seems to be an not-to-established music curation service industry out there
  - ~~None of them seems to be focused on tailoring-for-the-customer~~

  - Confirming that this is a good idea with a real audience out there

Project 0: auto-generating classical art images for spotify playlists

- go onto site
- user grants enough permission
- user selects the playlist for which she desires a generated cover
- image is generated based on the words/ambience quality of the song

Image can be scraped from:

- MET database
- https://metmuseum.github.io/ THEY HAVE A FUCKING API for you to scrape the damn DB
